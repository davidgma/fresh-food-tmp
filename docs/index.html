          Over the past 50 years - living memory for me - there has been a huge
          increase in obesity and chronic diseases.
        </p>
        <p>When I was at primary school, almost no one was fat.</p>
        <p>Yet the reasons given for this increase makes no sense to me.</p>

        <p>
          One theory is the 'thrift gene hypothesis'. This states that humans have evolved with frequent food shortages and famines and so have adapted to put on weight in times of plenty so as to survive the next famine. Under this theory, the recent rise in obesity is because now, for the first time ever, we have enough food to eat and no famine, and so just keep putting on weight.

          This boilerplate isn't meant for anything particularly spectacular - I
          just use it as a base (via
          <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/boilerplate-node-ts-sass"
            >forking it</a
          >) when I just want to try out something quick and simple.
